A 16-key (4 x 4) Keyboard/Numpad/Macropad/MIDI device designed by A-Tech Officials for easily getting started in the field of custom keyboards and open-source keyboard firmwares.

Learn, build, modify easily as the Protokeeb is an open-source hardware project.
The PCB is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico development board.
Designed for developers and enthusiasts who wants to begin their journey in the world of custom keyboards and keyboard firmware.

## Features

- Per-key south facing ARGB (WS2812B-2020) backlight LED.
- All anit-ghosting keys. Its a Mechanical Keyboard. Duh.
- Rotary Encoder with push button.
- USB Type-C. Not a feature anymore in 2024. #NoMoreMicroUSB
- Dedicated Bootselect and Reset Button.
- Supports different RP2040 based development boards that have similar SMD footprint and pinout to a Raspberry Pi Pico.
- 2MB/4MB Flash storage for all those feature packed firmwares.
- Keyboard Hardware supports QMK, KMK, and ZMK firmware.
- Support for both a Sandwich Style/Layered Case or a 3D printed Case.

## Supported Dev Boards

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Waveshare RP2040-Plus

# Instructions/Guide

There are two options to get started with Protokeeb hardware:

- First either order the fully assembled/soldered PCB from [atechofficials](https://atechofficials.com/protokeeb.) (Work-in-progress)
- Second download the gerber files and all necessary files to order the PCB from your local PCB fabrication house/company and source the components as per your convneince.

Option-1 will be a straight forward plug and play option because each Protokeeb board comes flashed with QMK firmware and the default keymap. So, you can easily tinker around and customize without worrying too much about the electronics.

Option-2 will be a DIY approach with detailed instructions for almost every step. So, that you can quickly start your custom keyboard journey filled with learning, development, and customization.

Note: Option-2 is not recommended for person who are absolute begineers in the field of electronics as this option requires certain set of skills and basic electronics knowledge, not to mention good SMD soldering skills and essentail tools.
